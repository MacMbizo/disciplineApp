# MCC Discipline Tracker Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the MCC Discipline Tracker application. It defines the approach, methodologies, tools, and processes that will be used to ensure the quality and reliability of the application throughout its development lifecycle.

## Guiding Principles

The testing strategy is guided by the following principles:

1. **Shift Left Testing**: Testing begins early in the development process to identify issues sooner.
2. **Automation First**: Automated testing is prioritized to enable frequent and consistent validation.
3. **Risk-Based Approach**: Testing efforts are focused on high-risk areas and critical functionality.
4. **Continuous Feedback**: Testing provides rapid feedback to developers to address issues quickly.
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Testing covers all aspects of the application, from unit to end-to-end testing.
6. **Quality Ownership**: Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just dedicated testers.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

**Objective**: Verify that individual units of code work as expected in isolation.

**Scope**:
- Individual functions, methods, and classes
- Service layer implementations
- Utility functions
- State management logic

**Approach**:
- Developers write unit tests alongside code implementation
- Test-driven development (TDD) is encouraged
- Each unit test focuses on a single functionality
- Mocks and stubs are used to isolate the unit being tested

**Tools**:
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Sinon for mocks, stubs, and spies

**Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical modules

**Example**:
```typescript
// Unit test for AuthService.signIn method
describe('AuthService.signIn', () => {
  let authService: AuthService;
  let mockFirebaseAuth: any;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup mocks
    mockFirebaseAuth = {
      signInWithEmailAndPassword: jest.fn(),
    };
    
    // Initialize service with mocks
    authService = new AuthService(mockFirebaseAuth);
  });
  
  it('should validate email and password before signing in', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const invalidEmail = 'not-an-email';
    const password = 'password123';
    
    // Act & Assert
    await expect(authService.signIn(invalidEmail, password))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('Invalid email format');
      
    // Verify Firebase auth was not called
    expect(mockFirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
  
  it('should return user data on successful sign in', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const email = 'test@example.com';
    const password = 'password123';
    const mockUser = { uid: 'user123', email };
    
    mockFirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword.mockResolvedValue({
      user: mockUser,
    });
    
    // Act
    const result = await authService.signIn(email, password);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(mockUser);
    expect(mockFirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword)
      .toHaveBeenCalledWith(email, password);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

**Objective**: Verify that different components of the application work together correctly.

**Scope**:
- Service interactions
- API integrations
- Database operations
- Authentication flows
- Navigation flows

**Approach**:
- Focus on testing the integration points between components
- Use real dependencies where practical, mocks where necessary
- Test complete workflows that span multiple components
- Verify data flows correctly between components

**Tools**:
- Jest for test execution
- Supertest for API testing
- Firebase Emulator Suite for Firebase services
- Mock Service Worker for API mocking

**Coverage Target**: All critical integration points covered

**Example**:
```typescript
// Integration test for incident creation flow
describe('Incident Creation Flow', () => {
  let disciplineService: DisciplineService;
  let authService: AuthService;
  let db: any;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup Firebase emulator
    db = getFirestoreEmulator();
    
    // Initialize services with emulator
    authService = new AuthService(getAuthEmulator());
    disciplineService = new DisciplineService(db);
    
    // Sign in as a teacher
    await authService.signIn('teacher@school.edu', 'password123');
  });
  
  it('should create an incident and store it in Firestore', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const newIncident = {
      studentId: 'student123',
      studentName: 'John Doe',
      teacherId: 'teacher456',
      teacherName: 'Jane Smith',
      schoolId: 'school789',
      incidentType: IncidentType.DISRUPTION,
      severity: IncidentSeverity.MEDIUM,
      description: 'Disrupted class by talking loudly',
      location: 'Classroom 101',
      dateTime: new Date(),
      actionTaken: 'Verbal warning',
      followUpRequired: false,
      parentNotified: true,
      parentNotificationDate: new Date(),
      status: IncidentStatus.RESOLVED,
    };
    
    // Act
    const createdIncident = await disciplineService.createIncident(newIncident);
    
    // Assert
    expect(createdIncident.id).toBeDefined();
    
    // Verify incident was stored in Firestore
    const storedIncident = await db
      .collection('incidents')
      .doc(createdIncident.id)
      .get();
      
    expect(storedIncident.exists).toBe(true);
    expect(storedIncident.data()).toMatchObject({
      studentId: newIncident.studentId,
      description: newIncident.description,
      // Other fields...
    });
  });
});
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Objective**: Verify that the application works correctly from the user's perspective, testing complete workflows.

**Scope**:
- User authentication flows
- Incident management workflows
- Reporting and analytics features
- Navigation and routing
- Form submissions
- Error handling and edge cases

**Approach**:
- Simulate real user interactions with the application
- Test complete user journeys from start to finish
- Focus on critical business workflows
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Test across different devices and screen sizes

**Tools**:
- Cypress for web application testing
- Detox for React Native mobile testing
- Firebase Emulator Suite for backend services

**Coverage Target**: All critical user journeys covered

**Example**:
```typescript
// E2E test for teacher recording an incident
describe('Teacher Records Incident', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Login as a teacher
    cy.login('teacher@school.edu', 'password123');
    
    // Navigate to the dashboard
    cy.visit('/dashboard');
  });
  
  it('should allow a teacher to record a new incident', () => {
    // Click on Record Incident button
    cy.findByText('Record Incident').click();
    
    // Fill out the incident form
    cy.findByLabelText('Student').select('John Doe');
    cy.findByLabelText('Incident Type').select('Disruption');
    cy.findByLabelText('Severity').select('Medium');
    cy.findByLabelText('Description').type('Disrupted class by talking loudly');
    cy.findByLabelText('Location').type('Classroom 101');
    cy.findByLabelText('Action Taken').type('Verbal warning');
    cy.findByLabelText('Parent Notified').check();
    
    // Submit the form
    cy.findByText('Submit').click();
    
    // Verify success message
    cy.findByText('Incident recorded successfully').should('be.visible');
    
    // Verify incident appears in the recent incidents list
    cy.visit('/incidents');
    cy.findByText('John Doe').should('be.visible');
    cy.findByText('Disruption').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

## Best Practices for Writing Tests

### Unit Tests

1. **Follow AAA Pattern**
   - Arrange: Set up the test conditions
   - Act: Perform the action being tested
   - Assert: Verify the expected outcome

2. **Test One Thing at a Time**
   - Each test should focus on a single behavior
   - Keep tests small and focused

3. **Use Descriptive Test Names**
   - Test names should describe the behavior being tested
   - Follow a consistent naming convention

4. **Avoid Test Interdependence**
   - Tests should not depend on other tests
   - Each test should be able to run in isolation

### Integration Tests

1. **Focus on Interfaces**
   - Test how components interact at their interfaces
   - Verify data flows correctly between components

2. **Use Real Dependencies When Possible**
   - Use actual dependencies for more realistic tests
   - Use Firebase Emulator Suite for Firebase services

3. **Test Complete Workflows**
   - Test end-to-end workflows that span multiple components
   - Verify the entire flow works correctly

### E2E Tests

1. **Test Critical User Journeys**
   - Focus on the most important user workflows
   - Cover both happy paths and error scenarios

2. **Keep Tests Stable**
   - Use stable selectors (data-testid, aria roles)
   - Add appropriate waits and assertions
   - Handle asynchronous operations properly

3. **Minimize Test Count**
   - E2E tests are slower and more brittle
   - Focus on critical paths rather than exhaustive coverage

## Test Maintenance

### Flaky Test Management

- Identify and track flaky tests
- Prioritize fixing flaky tests
- Quarantine flaky tests until fixed

### Test Refactoring

- Regular review of test code
- Refactor tests for maintainability
- Update tests when application code changes

### Documentation

- Document testing approach and standards
- Maintain up-to-date test plans
- Document known issues and workarounds

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the MCC Discipline Tracker application. By following this strategy, the development team can deliver a high-quality application that meets user needs and expectations.

The strategy should be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to changing project requirements and emerging best practices in testing.
