## Risk Response Planning

### Critical Risks (R12)
- Immediate action required
- Daily monitoring
- Escalation to project sponsors
- Implementation of technical debt tracking system as highest priority

### High Risks (R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, R7, R11, R14)
- Develop detailed mitigation plans
- Weekly monitoring
- Regular updates to stakeholders
- Assign specific owners with accountability for resolution
- Track progress in weekly status meetings

### Medium Risks (R4, R8, R9, R13, R15, R16, R17, R18)
- Standard mitigation strategies
- Bi-weekly monitoring
- Document in status reports
- Review during sprint planning sessions

### Low Risks (R10)
- Monitor as part of regular project activities
- Review monthly for changes in status
- Review during sprint retrospectives

## Risk Review Schedule
- Critical & High risks: Weekly review
- Medium risks: Bi-weekly review
- Low risks: Monthly review
- All risks: Comprehensive review at phase checkpoints
