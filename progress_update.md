## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing Performance and Offline Support

**Problem:** Implementing robust offline support while maintaining performance is challenging, especially with large datasets.

**Solution:** We're taking a phased approach, starting with performance optimizations (caching, query optimizations) before enhancing offline capabilities. This ensures the application performs well in both online and offline scenarios.

### Challenge: Service Layer Complexity

**Problem:** As we add more features to the service layer (caching, retry logic, validation), there's a risk of increasing complexity and reducing maintainability.

**Solution:** We're addressing this by extracting common functionality into base classes and utilities, implementing dependency injection for better testability, and maintaining comprehensive documentation of service layer patterns.

## Conclusion

The Firebase SDK documentation and implementation tasks provide a clear roadmap for enhancing the application's Firebase integration. By following the prioritized task list, we'll systematically improve performance, maintainability, and reliability while ensuring a consistent approach across all services.
