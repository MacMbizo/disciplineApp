# MCC Discipline Tracker - Technical Debt Tracking System

## Overview

This document tracks technical debt in the MCC Discipline Tracker project. Technical debt represents compromises made during development that may require future attention. By tracking these items, we ensure they are addressed systematically rather than forgotten.

## Prioritization Framework

| Priority | Description | Timeframe for Resolution |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Critical | Severely impacts functionality or security; requires immediate attention | Current sprint |
| High | Significantly affects performance, maintainability, or user experience | Next 1-2 sprints |
| Medium | Moderately impacts code quality or introduces minor limitations | Within next 3-4 sprints |
| Low | Minor issues that should be addressed when convenient | When resources permit |

## Current Technical Debt Items

| ID | Description | Category | Impact | Priority | Created Date | Resolution Plan | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| TD-1 | Firebase authentication implementation uses simplified error handling | Authentication | Limited user feedback on auth failures | Medium | YYYY-MM-DD | Implement comprehensive error handling with specific user messages | Open |
| TD-2 | Offline data synchronization lacks conflict resolution for complex scenarios | Data Management | Potential data inconsistencies during sync | High | YYYY-MM-DD | Implement version-based conflict resolution strategy | Open |
| TD-3 | Analytics dashboard uses direct Firestore queries instead of dedicated service layer | Architecture | Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | YYYY-MM-DD | Refactor to use proper service abstraction with caching | Open |
| TD-4 | Role-based navigation implemented with conditional rendering instead of proper route guards | Navigation | Potential security issues with route access | High | YYYY-MM-DD | Implement proper navigation guards with role verification | Open |
| TD-5 | Form validation uses basic validation without comprehensive error messaging | User Experience | Limited user guidance on form errors | Low | YYYY-MM-DD | Enhance validation with field-specific error messages | Open |
| TD-6 | Theme implementation uses direct style props instead of theme context in some components | UI | Inconsistent styling and maintenance challenges | Low | YYYY-MM-DD | Refactor components to use theme context consistently | Open |

## Implementation Shortcuts

| ID | Description | Justification | Affected Components | Resolution Plan |
|----|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| SC-1 | Using mock data for analytics dashboard initial implementation | Accelerate UI development while backend analytics are finalized | AnalyticsDashboard, ReportingService | Replace with actual data processing once backend is ready |
| SC-2 | Simplified offline storage schema for MVP | Meet initial release deadline | SyncService, OfflineStorage | Enhance with full schema support in Phase 4 |
| SC-3 | Limited error handling in API service layer | Focus on core functionality first | ApiService, NetworkService | Implement comprehensive error handling in Phase 2 |

## Known Limitations

| ID | Description | Impact | Workaround | Target Resolution Version |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|----------------------------|
| KL-1 | Offline mode does not support complex filtering of incidents | Users cannot perform advanced searches offline | Perform advanced searches when online | v1.2.0 |
| KL-2 | Real-time updates limited to critical notifications only | Some dashboard data may be slightly delayed | Manual refresh for latest data | v1.1.0 |
| KL-3 | Analytics processing limited to 90-day history in mobile app | Historical trend analysis limited on mobile | Use web dashboard for extended historical analysis | v1.3.0 |
| KL-4 | Image attachments for incidents limited to 5MB per incident | High-resolution photos may need compression | Compress images before upload | v1.2.0 |

## Resolved Items

| ID | Description | Resolution | Resolved Date | Version |
|----|-------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| TD-0 | Example resolved debt | Implemented proper solution | YYYY-MM-DD | v0.2.0 |

## Monitoring and Review

- Technical debt review scheduled bi-weekly
- New items added when identified during development or code reviews
- Priority reassessment performed monthly
- Critical and High items tracked in sprint planning
