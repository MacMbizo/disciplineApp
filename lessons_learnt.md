# MCC Discipline Tracker - Lessons Learnt

## Documentation Cadence
- Update after each sprint retrospective
- Add entries when significant challenges are overcome
- Review and consolidate monthly
## Development Environment
### Expo Configuration
- **Challenge:** Initial setup of Expo with TypeScript template requires careful configuration
- **Solution:** Follow the exact steps in the Expo documentation and verify tsconfig.json settings
- **Impact:** Proper initial setup prevents type-related issues later in development

## Service Layer Implementation
### Reporting Service Design
- **Challenge:** Creating a flexible reporting system that supports multiple output formats and report types
- **Solution:** Implemented a modular design with separate functions for each output format (PDF, CSV, Excel) and added support for report caching and scheduling
- **Impact:** This approach allows for easy extension with new report types and output formats while maintaining a clean API
- **Key Insight:** Mock implementations with detailed comments about production integration make it easier to replace with actual library code later

### Error Handling in Service Layers
- **Challenge:** Consistent error handling across service functions that interact with external libraries
- **Solution:** Implemented try/catch blocks with specific error messages and proper error propagation
- **Impact:** Improves debugging and provides clear feedback to calling code about what went wrong
- **Key Insight:** Including the original error message in thrown errors preserves the error chain

### Firebase Integration
- **Challenge:** Firebase SDK integration with Expo requires specific version compatibility
- **Solution:** Always check Expo compatibility matrix before updating Firebase packages
- **Impact:** Prevents breaking changes and ensures smooth authentication flow

## Architecture & Design

### State Management
- **Challenge:** Consistent state management across different features
- **Solution:** Established Redux Toolkit patterns for complex state and Context API for simpler states
- **Impact:** Maintainable and predictable state management across the application

### Service Layer Patterns
- **Challenge:** Maintaining consistency across multiple service implementations
- **Solution:** Created service layer template with standard error handling and response formatting
- **Impact:** Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

### Navigation Design (React Navigation)
- **Challenge:** Ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and type-safe navigation setup.
- **Solution:** Implemented several best practices in `AppNavigator.tsx`:
    - **Screen Name Constants:** Used a `ScreenNames` enum to define screen identifiers, preventing typos and centralizing screen names.
    - **Type-Safe Parameters:** Defined `RootStackParamList` to enforce type checking for navigation parameters, improving reliability.
    - **Modular Navigators (Planned):** Structured `AppNavigator.tsx` to easily accommodate future modular navigators (e.g., `AuthNavigator`, `MainAppNavigator`), promoting separation of concerns.
    - **Theme Integration:** Applied global theme styles to navigator elements (e.g., headers) using `defaultScreenOptions` for a consistent UI.
    - **JSDoc Comments:** Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to explain the navigator's structure, types, and enums.
- **Impact:** 
    - Improved code readability and maintainability.
    - Enhanced type safety, reducing runtime errors related to navigation.
    - Established a clear pattern for consistent UI styling in navigation components.
    - Prepared the navigation system for future scalability and complexity.
- **Key Insight:** Proactively applying these patterns to the navigation skeleton, even at an early stage, sets a strong foundation for a robust and developer-friendly navigation experience. Documenting these standards in `fullstack_config_recommendations.md` and `navigation_diagrams.md` ensures team alignment.

## UI Components

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent UI behavior across iOS and Android
- **Solution:** Extensive testing on both platforms and platform-specific adjustments when necessary
- **Impact:** Consistent user experience regardless of platform

## Testing

### Component Testing
- **Challenge:** Testing components with Firebase dependencies
- **Solution:** Created mock providers and context wrappers for testing
- **Impact:** Isolated component tests that don't require actual Firebase connections

## Performance

### List Rendering
- **Challenge:** Performance issues with large lists of students or incidents
- **Solution:** Implemented virtualized lists with React Native FlatList and pagination
- **Impact:** Smooth scrolling and reduced memory usage

## Offline Functionality

### Data Synchronization
- **Challenge:** Managing conflicts between offline changes and server updates
- **Solution:** Implemented timestamp-based conflict resolution strategy
- **Impact:** Reliable data synchronization with minimal user intervention

## Deployment

### EAS Build Configuration
- **Challenge:** Setting up proper build profiles for different environments
- **Solution:** Created separate build profiles with environment-specific variables
- **Impact:** Streamlined build process for development, testing, and production

## Authentication Implementation

### Firebase Authentication Integration
- **Challenge:** Creating a robust authentication service with proper error handling, caching, and telemetry
- **Solution:** Implemented a singleton pattern with comprehensive error handling, rate limiting, and profile caching
- **Impact:** Improved user experience with faster profile loading and meaningful error messages
- **Key Insight:** Separating authentication logic from UI components makes testing easier and improves maintainability

### User Profile Management
- **Challenge:** Efficiently managing user profile data between Firebase Auth and Firestore
- **Solution:** Implemented a caching strategy with cache invalidation on profile updates
- **Impact:** Reduced database reads and improved application performance
- **Key Insight:** Using a service registry pattern allows for better dependency management and testability

## Project Management

### Task Complexity Estimation
- **Challenge:** Accurately estimating task complexity, especially for Firebase integration
- **Solution:** Added buffer time for integration tasks and broke down complex tasks
- **Impact:** More realistic timelines and better resource allocation
